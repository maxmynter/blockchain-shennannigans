Dockerize application

Next steps:
- add mempool for pending messages and transactions
- implement transaction batching
- create more efficient sync (not whole chain, but block headers, only getting missing blocks, etc.)
- Blockchain storage persistence
- Dynamic block difficulty (?)
- Remove old single message/ single block implementation in favour of mempooled versions.
