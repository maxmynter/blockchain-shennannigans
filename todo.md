The block added function does not chek validity of the chain in total. 
It checks only the hashes. And not even if the block results in the hash.


I want hot reloding of the nodes and the chain periodically in the frontend.

Also the backend must query the other nodes for the best chain (& check their validity)

I want an alive check when adding nodes. Nodes are only added when they respond.
