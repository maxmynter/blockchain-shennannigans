#RustChain Implementation Plan



# Phase 1: Fix Critical Issues & Core Functionality (2 weeks)

## Fix Current Implementation Issues

Parameterize mempool size in configuration
Implement graceful shutdown with CTRL+C signal handling
Fix frontend submission functionality
Prevent duplicate transactions in mining
Fix transaction removal logic to only remove confirmed transactions
Clarify/fix mining logic between automatic and manual generation


## Wallet & Transaction System

Implement basic key pair generation using ed25519 or secp256k1
Create wallet structure and storage
Design transaction model with inputs/outputs
Implement digital signatures for transactions


## Mempool Improvements

Fix pending transaction tracking
Implement proper transaction validation
Create better transaction selection strategy



## Theory to study:

Cryptographic key pairs and digital signatures
UTXO vs Account-based models
Transaction validation in Bitcoin/Ethereum

# Phase 2: Networking & Consensus Improvements (2 weeks)

## P2P Communication (replace HTTP)

Implement libp2p for peer-to-peer communication
Create network message types for chain communication
Implement node discovery mechanism


## Blockchain Synchronization

Implement efficient header-first sync
Add block verification during sync
Create catch-up mechanism for new nodes


## Mining Enhancements

Integrate transaction fees
Implement mining rewards
Create adjustable difficulty algorithm



## Theory to study:

P2P network protocols (especially libp2p)
Blockchain synchronization algorithms
Difficulty adjustment mechanisms

# Phase 3: Advanced Features & Refinement (2-4 weeks)

## State Management

Implement UTXO set or account state
Create efficient state verification
Add state transitions based on transactions


## Smart Contract Foundation (optional)

Design simple VM or WASM integration

## UI and Documentation

Enhance dashboard with transaction/wallet info
Add real-time updates
Create comprehensive documentation
Dockerize for easy deployment



## Theory to study:

Blockchain state management
Simple virtual machines or WASM
WebSocket/real-time communication
